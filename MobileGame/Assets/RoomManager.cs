     * Make camera snap to center of room smoothly when entered
     * Locate doors connected to room via triggers
     * Close the doors once the player is inside the room (force animation?)
     * Spawn enemies (random enemy, position, and amount)
     * Detect when all enemies are no longer in room (killed)
     * Open all doors
     * Detect items left in rooms (icons on minimap)
